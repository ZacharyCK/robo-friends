# This project was made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this app does

This is my first project I completed using React. It is a simple project to get some warm fuzzy feelings with the features of React.

In this project, you see 10 cards with user info (this is dummy data fetched from the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) api). The pictures of the robots are also generated by the [robohash](https://robohash.org/) api. The main feature of this app is to let you filter the user card components based on what you type in the search bar. When you type a new letter... then presto uno! You will see a filtered selection of robots that contain that string of characters in their name.

Hope you enjoy my first little react app!
